      <h3>Define Survey:</h3>
      <p>Surveying is the art of determining relative positions of the points on earth's surface.</p>
      <p>It is done through observation & taking measurements & determining the boundaries, sizes, positions, quantity, value etc of lands, estates, buildings, farms etc.</p>
      
      <h3>Objectives of Surveying</h3>
      <p>Primary purpose of surveying is to measure and record field data from which accurate plans & maps can be prepared, usually through:</p>
      <p>i) Determining horizontal distance between two or more points on the earth's surface</p>
      <p>ii) Determining vertical distance between two different points on the earth's surface</p>
      <p>iii) Determining the area of a given piece of land</p>
      <p>iv) Locating the directions of various features on the earth's surface</p>

      <h3>Classification of Survey</h3>
      <p>Surveys can be classified based on several factors.</p>
      <p>The most common classification is based on purpose & field application:</p>
      <p>- By instrument used</p>
      <p>- By method employed</p>
      
      <h4>i) Based on earth's curvature</h4>
      <p>This is the primary fundamental classification of survey.</p>
      <p>It's further divided into two types of survey:</p>
      <p>i) Geodetic survey</p>
      <p>ii) Plane survey</p>
      
      <h4>a) Geodetic surveys</h4>
      <p>These are surveys that cover a large area, i.e., a country or a continent. It uses complex mathematics and a spheroidal model of the earth.</p>
      
      <h4>b) Plane survey</h4>
      <p>These are surveys done in small areas.</p>
      <p>The surface is assumed to be a flat plane.</p>
      <p>This simplifies calculations & it is mostly used for engineering projects, cross country highways.</p>
      <p><b>N/B:</b> Unless you are building a tunnel you will always use plane survey.</p>
      
      <h4>ii) Based on purpose & field of application</h4>
      <p>This is how surveys in disciplines are defined by their end use.</p>
      <p><b>Topographic survey:</b> This is survey done to gather data of natural & manmade features on the earth & represent them on a map.</p>
      
      <h4>b) Cadastral Survey</h4>
      <p>This is survey done to determine and mark property boundaries. It is also a legally binding type of survey.</p>
      
      <h4>c) Engineering Survey</h4>
      <p>Done to collect data for the planning, design & construction of engineering works. It involves setting out where dimensions are transferred on the ground with dimension control, ensuring construction follows design dimensions.</p>
      
      <h4>d) Control Survey</h4>
      <p>Is done to establish a network of horizontal & vertical reference points (bench marks) across a project and provides the fundamental framework of control points from which all other surveys and setting out are done.</p>
      
      <h4>iii) Based on instrument used</h4>
      <p>This classification is based on the primary tools employed:</p>
      <p>i) <b>Theodolite survey:</b> It is applied when measuring horizontal and vertical angles</p>
      <p>ii) <b>Compass / Chain:</b> It is applied when measuring direction / bearings</p>
      <p>iii) <b>Tapes & Ranging rods:</b> It is applied when measuring distances for small and open areas</p>
      <p>iv) <b>Dumpy levels, Automatic level & Digital levels:</b> They are used to determine height differences and establish elevations.</p>
      <p>v) <b>Echo sounders:</b> Used in mapping the bed & features of water bodies</p>
      <p>vi) <b>Drones & Cameras:</b> Used when creating maps and 3D models from aerial photographs</p>
      <p>vii) <b>Total station:</b> It integrates electronic distance measurement for measuring distances using electromagnetic waves. This is the standard modern distance measurement.</p>
      <p>viii) <b>Remote sensing:</b> Which uses satellites and gathers information about surface without physical interference.</p>
      <p>ix) <b>GPS survey:</b> It determines absolute position i.e. latitude, longitude using satellite.</p>
      
      <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid var(--accent)">
      
      <h3>iv) Based on method employed</h3>
      <p>This focus on geometric technique for determining positions.</p>
      <p>Classification based on this survey:</p>
      <p>i) <b>Triangulation:</b> A system of triangles are established, angles are measured precisely & only a few baseline distances are needed.</p>
      <p>ii) <b>Traversing:</b> A series of connected lines are established, the length & directions of this line are measured. It is the most common method of establishing control networks on construction site.</p>
      <p>iii) <b>Trilateration:</b> A network of triangles are established by measuring all the sides with EDM or no angles measured. It is common in EDM i.e. total station surveys which uses the principle of GPS.</p>

      <h3>PRINCIPLES OF SURVEY</h3>
      <p><b>4. Principle of working from whole to part:</b> Is achieved by first identifying the primary control point</p>
      
      <p><b>Control point:</b> Is a point on the ground whose horizontal and vertical location is known. This points are located with a high precision using sophisticated equipment. Based on this point (primary point) number of large triangles are drawn. Secondary control point are then established to fill the gaps with lesser precision than primary control point. Tertiary control points are also established at a moderate and less precise level.</p>

          <circle cx="220" cy="140" r="2" fill="green"/>
        </svg>
      </div>
      
      <p>In other terms this principle involves covering the area to be surveyed with large triangles which are further divided into small triangles and the process continuous until the area has been covered with small triangles to a level that allows detailed surveys to be made.</p>
      
      <p><b>Using measurements from two known control point to fix other points:</b> Given two points whose length and bearing have been accurately established a line can be drawn to join them. Hence surveying has control reference points, the location of various other points and the lines joining them can be fixed by measurement made from this two points. For example in point A & B are the control point the following operation can be performed to fix other points, one of the operation:</p>

      <h4>2. Checking of Measurements</h4>
      <p>All survey work must be checked in such a way that any error will be apparent by the survey is completed. Care and concentration are necessary in order to ensure that all measures are taken to the required degree of accuracy & that nothing is omitted.</p>
      
      <p>Surveyors on site should be checking the correctness of both his own work and that of others based on his information. Measurements should be checked constantly. Survey records & computations such field notes, level books, field books, setting out & levelling books must be kept clean & complete with clear notes and diagrams so that the survey data can be clearly understood by others.</p>
      
      <p>It checks are not done on observation expensive mistakes may occurs. It is always preferable to derive a few more information on site to ensure that the survey will resolve itself at the plotting stage and this is where accuracy and precision.</p>
      
      <p>The term are commonly used by manufacturers of surveying equipment as well as surveyors to describe results obtained from the field work.</p>
      
      <p><b>Accuracy:</b> Allows a certain amount of tolerance error in measurement</p>
      <p><b>Precision:</b> Demands exactness in reading and</p>
      
      <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid var(--accent)">
      
      <p><b>N/B:</b> Scientific honesty is important in surveying</p>
      
      <h3>PROCESS OF SURVEYING</h3>
      <p>It is done in three main phases:</p>
      <p>1. Conduct of reconnaissance</p>
      <p>2. Field work and Measurements</p>
      <p>3. Office work</p>
      
      <h4>1. Reconnaissance</h4>
      <p>This is the pre-field work and measurement phase. It requires an overall inspection of the area to obtain a general view by commencement of any serious surveys.</p>
      
      <p>Walking through the site enables one to understand the terrain and helps in determining the survey method to be adopted and the scale to be used.</p>
      
      <p>The initial information obtained helps in successful planning and execution of the surveying job.</p>
      
      <p><b>Objectives of Reconnaissance:</b></p>
      <p>1. To understand what you may be dealing with</p>
      <p>2. To understand which method to be used</p>
      <p>3. Estimate cost and time required</p>
      <p>4. To ascertain the possibility of building or constructing a route</p>
      <p>5. To choose the most suitable position for stations</p>
      
      <h4>2. Field Work & Measurement</h4>
      <p>This is where actual measurement and recording are taken to get the best results. The surveyors must be fully familiar with the functions of equipment and take care of them.</p>
      
      <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid var(--accent)">
      
      <h4>3. Office Work</h4>
      <p>This is the post-field work stage. In which data collected and recordings in the field notebooks are recorded to prepare the charts, plans and maps for presentation to the client and target audience.</p>
      
      <h3>Horizontal Distance Measurement</h3>
      <p>This is the basic measurement in survey which determines the distance btn 2 points on the earth's surface for use in fixing positions, setting out & scaling.</p>
      
      <p>The method to be employed in measuring distance depends on accuracy of the measurement and in turn depends on purpose for which the measurement is intended.</p>
      
      <p><b>Some of the method used:</b></p>
      <p>1. <b>Pacing:</b> This is where distance is obtained by the number of paces which are manually counted, or by a pedometer register attached to one length. The average pace length has to be known by pacing known distance several times and taking the average. It is commonly used in small scale mapping.</p>

      <p>2. <b>Tachometry:</b> Distance can be measured indirectly by optical surveying instrument such as Theodolite. The method is rapid and accurate.</p>
      
      <p>3. <b>Chaining:</b> This method involves direct measurement with a tape or chain. Steel tape is commonly used in this type of survey.</p>

      <p><b>Other tapes it can be also used include:</b> Invar tape, Hapu tape, Linen tape, Fiberglass tape.</p>
      
      <p>4. <b>EDM:</b> These are indirect distance measuring instruments that works using the invariant velocity of light or electromagnetic waves in a vacuum. They have a high degree of accuracy and are effectively used for long distance and for modern survey operations.</p>

      <h3>Errors in Surveying</h3>
      <p><b>An error is a difference btn measured and true value of quantity.</b></p>
      
      <p><b>There are three types of survey errors:</b></p>
      <p>i) <b>Gross errors / Mistakes:</b> Mistakes made by surveyer, instrument handler or due to carelessness, inexperience or fatigue.</p>
      <p><b>Examples of Gross errors:</b></p>
      <p>- Misreading an instrument scale</p>
      <p>- Writing down wrong figures in the field book</p>
      <p>- Using the wrong station or target</p>
      <p>- Entering wrong units</p>
      <p>- Missing a reading</p>
      <p><b>Characteristic of Gross error:</b> Are usually large in magnitude</p>
      
      <p>2. They occur irregularly</p>
      <p>3. They cannot be corrected by mathematical adjustment</p>
      
      <p><b>Prevention & Control:</b></p>
      <p>a) Proper training & Supervision</p>
      <p>b) Checking readings in the field</p>
      <p>c) Use the principle of checking measurement & calculation</p>
      <p>d) Ensure proper instrument manipulation & data recording</p>
      
      <p>ii) <b>Systematic Errors:</b> These are errors that follow a definite pattern & occur in the same direction and magnitude under the same conditions. They are predictable and can often be calculated and corrected.</p>
      
      <p><b>Causes of Systematic Errors:</b></p>
      <p>a) <b>Instrumental errors:</b> Due to imperfections in instrument design or adjustment i.e. Tape too long or too short, level bubbles not centered.</p>
      <p>b) <b>Natural errors:</b> Caused due to environmental factors i.e. temperature changes.</p>
      <p>c) <b>Personal errors:</b> Caused due to observer's habit or reaction time.</p>

      <p>c) Take readings in opposite directions</p>
      <p>d) Reduce natural effects</p>
      
      <p>iii) <b>Random Errors:</b> Are small unpredictable variations that occur without any fixed pattern.</p>

      <h3>CHAIN SURVEYING</h3>
      <p>Chain surveying is the simplest and oldest method of surveying whose basic principle involves making linear measurements only i.e. measuring the distance btn points on the ground to determine relative position.</p>
      
      <p>Unlike modern surveying which relies on angles & electronic equipment, chain surveying focuses on measuring distances to create a network of triangles from which a map or plan is plotted.</p>
      
      <p><b>Principle of Chain Surveying:</b> Fundamental principle of chain survey is Triangulation.</p>
      <p>A large area is divided into a network of triangles because it is the only simple geometric figure that can be plotted uniquely if the length of three sides is known. Surveyor measures the sides of this triangles directly in the field with no angular measurement being taken and once this sides are measured, the entire framework can be plotted to scale on paper.</p>

      <p><b>Types of Chain:</b></p>
      <p>1. Gunter Chain → 66ft = 100 links</p>
      <p>2. Engineer Chain → 100ft = 100 links</p>
      <p>3. Metric Chain → 20m = 100 links, 30m = 150 links</p>
      
      <p><b>Key Equipment / Tools Used:</b></p>
      <p>1. <b>Chain:</b> Usually made of steel wire & consists of long links joined by shorter links. Each link measures 200mm from center to center of each middle connecting link.</p>
      
      <p>2. <b>Steel bands/Tapes:</b> May be 30m or 100m long and 13mm wide. Used where greater accuracy of measurement is required. Marked in cm, mm. Types: Linen tape, Fiberglass, Invar tape, Steel tape.</p>
      
      <p>3. <b>Arrows:</b> Metal pins 40cm long used to mark the end of each chain length during measurement.</p>
      
      <p>4. <b>Ranging rods:</b> Long painted rods (black & white) used to mark survey point & for ranging out straight lines btn distant points.</p>
      
      <p>5. <b>Pegs:</b> Wooden pegs hammered into ground to permanently mark survey stations.</p>
      
      <p>6. <b>Offset rod:</b> Rod similar to ranging rod but with hook at end used for taking perpendicular offset.</p>
      
      <p>7. <b>Cross staff:</b> Used to set out perpendicular lines for taking offsets.</p>
      
      <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid var(--accent)">
      
      <h3>Basic Terms Used in Chain Survey</h3>
      <p>1. <b>Survey Station:</b> Main points that form vertices of triangles. Sub-divided into:</p>
      <p>(i) Main Station: Stations taken along boundary area</p>
      <p>(ii) Tie Station: Stations selected on main survey line to locate interior details</p>
      
      <p>2. <b>Baseline:</b> The longest & most important line in survey. Measured very carefully & precisely. The entire framework is built upon this line.</p>
      
      <p>3. <b>Check line:</b> A line measured to check the accuracy of the framework.</p>
      
      <p>4. <b>Tie line:</b> A line joining tie stations to locate interior details.</p>
      
      <p>5. <b>Offsets:</b> Lateral measurements from a survey line to locate details of a building, boundary, tree, etc. Usually taken perpendicular to the main line.</p>
      <p>Types: (i) Perpendicular offset taken at 90° to survey line - most common & accurate</p>
      <p>(ii) Oblique offset taken at an angle other than 90° - used when perpendicular offset is not possible</p>
      
      <p>6. <b>Survey line:</b> Lines joining the main survey stations.</p>
      
      <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid var(--accent)">
      
      <h3>Necessary Precautions in Using Surveying Instruments</h3>
      <p>- After use in wet weather chains should be cleaned & steel tape should be dried & wiped with an oil cloth</p>
      <p>- A piece of coloured cloth should be tied to arrows to enable them to be seen clearly</p>
      <p>- The operating tension & temperature for which steel bands & tapes are graduated should be indicated</p>
      <p>- Always keep tapes reeled up when not in use</p>
      
      <h3>Procedure for Chaining</h3>
      <p>1. <b>Conduct a reconnaissance:</b> Walk over the area to be surveying and note the general layout, the positions of features and the shape of the area</p>
      <p>2. <b>Choice of Stations:</b> Design a plan of the framework to be used and drive in the station pegs to mark the station selected</p>
      <p>3. <b>Station Marking:</b> Station marks should be either located somewhere possible to be tied into a permanent object so that they be easily replaced or moved during survey</p>
      <p>4. <b>Witnessing:</b> This consists of making a sketch of the immediate area around the station showing existing permanent features, the position of features, the station and its description and designation. Measurements are then made from at least 3 surrounding features to the station point and recorded on the sketch. The aim of witnessing is to relocate a station again at much later days even by others after a long intervals</p>
      <p>5. <b>Offsetting:</b> Offsets are usually taken perpendicular to chain line in order to detail obstacles/obstructions on the chain line</p>
      <p>6. <b>Sketching:</b> This is the layout on the last page on the chain book together with the date & the name of survey & longest line of surveying which is usually taken as baseline and is measured first</p>

      <h3>Method of Measuring a Chain Line</h3>
      <p>Chaining a line involves taking linear measurement which is defined as the horizontal measurement of the distance btn two surfaces. This is carried out by three chain men i.e the leader, follower & assistant.</p>
      
      <p>Ranging rods are inserted as close as possible to the station pegs so that the position of the peg may be located from a distance. In case of long lines, they are placed immediately btn the stations & lined in by eye to enable a straight line to be measured.</p>

      </div>
      
      <p>The follower stands at the starting peg holding one end of the chain, while the leader drags the other end forward with arrows & ranging rods.</p>
      
      <p>The leader straightens the chain, ensures it’s taut and horizontal, then places an arrow at the end of the chain length. The follower then moves to this arrow and the process repeats.</p>
      
      <p><b>N/B:</b> Chain must be pulled tight, horizontal, and free from sag for accurate measurements.</p>

      <h3>CORRECTIONS IN CHAIN SURVEYING</h3>
      <p>All measurements taken in the field are subject to errors. Corrections are applied to get true distances.</p>
      
      <p><b>1. Correction for Standardization:</b></p>
      <p>If chain is too long: Correction = - Error per chain × No. of chains</p>
      <p>If chain is too short: Correction = + Error per chain × No. of chains</p>
      <p>True Distance = Measured Distance ± Correction</p>
      
      <p><b>2. Correction for Temperature:</b></p>
      <p>$$C_t = L \times \alpha \times (T_m - T_o)$$</p>
      <p>Where: L = measured length, α = coefficient of expansion, T_m = mean temp, T_o = standard temp</p>
      
      <p><b>3. Correction for Pull/Tension:</b></p>
      <p>$$C_p = \frac{(P - P_o)L}{AE}$$</p>
      <p>Where: P = pull applied, P_o = standard pull, A = cross-sectional area, E = Young’s modulus</p>
      
      <p><b>4. Correction for Sag:</b></p>
      <p>$$C_s = \frac{W^2L}{24P^2}$$</p>
      <p>Always negative. W = weight of chain, L = length, P = pull</p>
      
      <p><b>5. Correction for Slope:</b></p>
      <p>For steep slopes, reduce to horizontal: $H = L \cos \theta$ or $C_{slope} = L(1 - \cos \theta)$</p>

      <p><b>Advantages:</b> Very accurate, suitable for small areas, roads, railways.</p>
      <p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Slow, expensive, tedious for large areas.</p>
      <p><b>Importance:</b> Used for detailed engineering works where high accuracy is needed.</p>
      
      <p><b>2. Indirect Method:</b> Spot levels taken at regular intervals, contours interpolated.</p>
      <p><b>a) Grid Method:</b> Area divided into squares, levels at corners.</p>
      <p><b>b) Cross-section Method:</b> Cross-sections taken at regular intervals along centerline.</p>
      <p><b>c) Radial Line Method:</b> Radiating lines from central point, levels taken along lines.</p>
      
      <p><b>Advantages of Indirect:</b> Faster, economical, suitable for large areas.</p>
      <p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Less accurate than direct method.</p>
